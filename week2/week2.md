### Agile Principles

(Organizational)
1. Put the customer at the center
2. Accept change
3. Let the team self-organize
4. Maintain a sustainable pace
5. Produce minimal software:
  5.1 Produce minimal functionality
  5.2 Produce only the product requested
  5.3 Develop only code and test
(Technical)
6. Develop iteratively
  6.1 Produce frecuents working scenarios
  6.2 Freeze requirements during iterations
7. Treat test as key resource
  7.1 Do not start any new development until all test pass
  7.2 Test first
8. Express requirements through scenarios


### 1. Put the customer at the center

Beck: You will get [better] results with real customers. The are who you
are trying to please. No customer at all, or a "proxy" got a real 
customer, leads to waste as you develop features that aren't used, specify
tests that don't reflect the real acceptance criteria, and lose the chance
to build a real relationship between the people with the most diverse
perspective of the project.

XP: embedded customer
Scrum: product owner

Can customer involvment replace requirements?

### 2. Accept change

Agile manifesto: "Welcome" change

In standard software engineering, especially object-oriented:
extendibility

Poppendieck: While in theory OO development produces
code that is easy to change, in practice OO systems can be
as difficult to change as any other, especially when information
hiding is not deeply understood and effecively used.




### 3. Let the team self-organize

Traditional view: managers tell workers to do their job
Agile: managers listen to developers, explain possible actions,
provide suggestions for improvments

The leader is there to:

* Encourage process
* Help catch errors
* Remove impediments
* Provide support and hepl in difficult situations
* Make sure that skepticism does not ruin the team's spirit

Team chooses own commitments and has access to customers
