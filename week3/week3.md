### Introduction to week 3

1. Traditional manager roles
2. The 3 Scrum roles
3. Other agile roles

#### The three Scrum roles

**The team**
* Is cross-function
* Has 7 +/- 2 members
* Selects iteration goal and work results
* Organizes itself and its work
* Can do everything within guidelines to reach goals
* Demos work results to product owner

**Core participants and fellow travelers**

**Product Owner**
* Defines product features
* Decides on release date 
* Decides on release content
* Responsible for product profitability (ROI)
* Prioritizes features according to market value
* Can change features and priority over 30 days
* Accepts or rejects work results

**Scrum Master**
* Ensures that team is functional and productive
* Enables cooperation across all roles and functions
* Shields team from external interferences
* Enforces process: daily meeting, planning and review meeting
* Removes impediments
* Normally, does no develop

**Technical Scrum Master**

**If there is a Manager:**
* Support team in it use of Scrum
* Contribute wisdom, expertise and assistance
* Do not "play nanny"
  - "Assign tasks, get status reports, and others forms of micromanagement
* Instead, "play guru"
  - Mentor, coach, devil's advocate, help remove impediments and solve problems
* May need to evolve their management style, e.g. use Socratic questioning to help team discover solutions (rathen than imposing a solution)


**Expert User** (Crystal)

* Person with expert knowledge of the project
* Should be actul user (not just a tester)
* Meetings (minumun) once a week, two-hour with the expert user, and the ability to make phone calls

**Customer**(XP)
* Trust developers' technical decisions
* Analyze risk correctly, weighing stories agains each other
* Provide precise stories
* Choose stories with maximum value
* With within team, providing guidance and receiving feedback as quickly and accurately as possible.

**Developer**
**Main job**: turn customer stories into working code.

***Developer obligations:***
* Know and understand technical issues
- Create and maintain the system as it evolves
* Answer: “How will we implement it?”, “How long will it take?” & “What are the risks?”
* Work with customer to understand his stories
* From a story, decide implementation
* Estimate work for each story, based on implementation decisions & experience
* Identify features that depend on other features
* Identify risky features and report them to customer
* Follow team guidelines
* Implement only what is necessary
* Communicate constantly with customers

***Developer Rights:***
* Estimate own work
* Work sensible & predictable schedule, by scheduling only work that can be done
* Produce code that meets the customer’s needs, by focusing on testing, refactoring, and customer communication
* Avoid need to make business decisions, by allowing the customer to make them 


**Tracker** (XP, Scrum)
* Keeps track of the schedule
* Most important metric
  - Velocity: ratio of ideal time estimated for tasks to actual time spent implementing them
* Other important data:
  - Changes in velocity
  - Amount of overtime worked
  - Ratio of passing to failing test

These numbers measure progress and the rate of progress and help determine if the project is on schedule for the iteration.

To measure velocity within the iteration, every day of two, the tracker asks each developer how many task he has completed.

**Coach** (XP)
* Guides team
* Mentor team
* Leads by example
* Teach when necessary
* May tech by doing
* May offer ideas to solve thorny problems
* May serve as intermediary with management
