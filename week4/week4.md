5. Management and others

### 1. Meetings

**Daily meeting**
* Held every morning
* **Goal**: set the day's work, in the broader context of the project
* Time-limited, usually 15 minutes (stand-up meeting)
* Involves all team members, with special role for "committed"
* Focus:
  - Defining commitments
  - Uncovering impediments
* Resolution will take place outside of meetings

Planning Meetings, Review Meetings

**Daily Meeting: The 3 questions**
The daily meeting requires every team memer to answer 3 questions:
* What did you do yesterday?
* What will you do today?
* Are there any impediments in your way?

**Planning Meeting**
* At beginning of every sprint
* **Goal**: define work from sprint
* Outcome: Spring Backlog, with time estimate for every task
* 8-hour time limit
  - 1st half, Product Owner + Team: prioritize Product Backlog
  - 2nd half, Team only: plan for Sprint, producing Sprint Backlog

**Retrospective Meeting**
* At end of every sprint
* All team members reflect on past Sprint
* Make continuous process improvements
* Two main questions:
  - What went well?
  - What could be improved?
* 3-hour time limit

**Review Meeting**
* At end of every sprint
* Review work:
  - Completed
  - Not completed
* Present and demo completed work to stakeholders
* Incomplete work cannot be demostrated
* 4-hour time limit

**Reflective Improvement** (Crystal)
* Developers must take breaks from regular development to look for ways to improve the process
* Iterations help with this by providing feedback on whether or not the current process is working

**What we have seen:**
* Agile development is characterized by a set of well-defined meetings
* Most important is the Daily Meeting
* In Scrum: Planning and Review Meetings
* Require adaptations for distributed teams



### 2. Development

**Pair Programming**
Two programmers sitting at one machine, thinking out loud.

**Goals**
* Make thinking process explicit
* Keep each other on task
* Brainstorm refinements to systems
* Clarify ideas
* Take initiative when other stuck, lowering frustration
* Hold each other accountable to team practices
