### Artifacts 

From user stories to burndown charts

**User Story** (XP, Scrum)
* Defines a atom of functionality
* See lecture on practices

Story card, Task card

**Use Case**
Describes how to achieve single business goal or task through the interactions between external actors and system

One of the UML diagram types

**Use Cases vs User Stories**

**User Story**
* Very simple
* Written by customer
* incomplete, possibly inaccurate
* Does not handle exceptional cases
* Starting point for additional discussions with customer

**Use Case**
* More complex
* Written by developer in cooperation with customer
* Attempts to be complete, accurate
* Should handle all possible cases
* Intended to answer any developer questions about customer requirements without further inteaction with customer

**Product Backlog** (Scrum)
* Maintained throughout project
* Property of Product Owner
* Open and editable by anyone
* Contains backlog items: broad descriptions of all potential features, prioritized by business value
* Includes estimates of business value
* Includes estimates of development effort, set by team

Visualized in "task board"

**Task Board, Story Board** (Scrum)
Used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint: "to do", "in progress", "done".

Benefits
* Transparency
* Collaboration
* Prioritization
* Focus
* Self-organization
* Empiricism
* "Humility"
* Morale

So the ***user stories***, are really starting points for discussions.
And the ***use cases*** are starting points for the development.

**Velocity** (Scrum)

Measure of progress in a project:

    Number of items delivered
 
* Measured in tasks, user stories, backlog items, ...

**Burntdown chart** (Scrum)

Puclicly displayed chart, update every day, showing for the sprint backlog:
* Remaining work
* Progress


**Bullpen** (XP)

Single, open room
(See "informative workspace" principle)

What we have seen: 
* Virtual and material tools that directly support agile concepts




### Assessment of Agile methods

**The Ugly**
* Rejection of upfront tasks (analysis paralysis)
  - Particularly: no upfront requirements
  - Dismissal of a priori architecture work
* User stories as a replacement for abstract requirements
* Test as a replacement for specifications
* Feature-based development and ignorace of dependencies
* Method keeper (e.g. Scrum Master) as a separate role
* Test-driven development (but not the rest of agile's emphasis on test)
* Dismissal of traditional manager task
* Dismissal of auxiliary products and non-shippable artifacts
* Dismissal of priori concern for extendibility
* Dismissal of priori concern for reusability

**The infifferent**
* Pair programming
* Open-space working arrangements
* Self-organizing teams
* Maintaining a sustainable pace
* Producing minimal functionality
* Planning poker
* Cross-functional teams
* Embedded customer

**The good**
* Acceptance of change
* Iterative devlopment
* Emphasis on working code
* Test as one of the key resources of the projects
* Constant test regression analysis
* Notion of velocity
* No branching
* Product (but not user stories!) burndown chart
* Daily meeting

**The brilliant**
* Short iterations
* Closed-window rule
* Refactoring (but not as a substitute for design)
* Associating a test with every piece of functionality
* Continuous integration


**Final observations**
* Software development is hard; quality is key
* Lots of good ideas can help; there is no reason to reject those form any particular style of software engineering
  - Particularly in the absence of credible empirical data
* Agile will find its place in the history of productive software engineering ideas
