### Artifacts 

From user stories to burndown charts

**User Story** (XP, Scrum)
* Defines a atom of functionality
* See lecture on practices

Story card, Task card

**Use Case**
Describes how to achieve single business goal or task through the interactions between external actors and system

One of the UML diagram types

**Use Cases vs User Stories**

**User Story**
* Very simple
* Written by customer
* incomplete, possibly inaccurate
* Does not handle exceptional cases
* Starting point for additional discussions with customer

**Use Case**
* More complex
* Written by developer in cooperation with customer
* Attempts to be complete, accurate
* Should handle all possible cases
* Intended to answer any developer questions about customer requirements without further inteaction with customer

**Product Backlog** (Scrum)
* Maintained throughout project
* Property of Product Owner
* Open and editable by anyone
* Contains backlog items: broad descriptions of all potential features, prioritized by business value
* Includes estimates of business value
* Includes estimates of development effort, set by team

Visualized in "task board"

**Task Board, Story Board** (Scrum)
Used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint: "to do", "in progress", "done".

Benefits
* Transparency
* Collaboration
* Prioritization
* Focus
* Self-organization
* Empiricism
* "Humility"
* Morale

So the ***user stories***, are really starting points for discussions.
And the ***use cases*** are starting points for the development.
